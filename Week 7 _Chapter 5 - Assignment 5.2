    =>  Write a program that repeatedly prompts a user for integer numbers until the user enters 'done'.
        Once 'done' is entered, print out the largest and smallest of the numbers.
        If the user enters anything other than a valid number catch it with a try/except and put out an appropriate message

        numb = int(num)
    except:
        print ("Invalid input")
        continue
    if smallest is None:
        smallest = numb 
    elif numb < smallest :
        smallest = numb
    if largest is None:
        largest = numb
    elif numb > largest:
        largest = numb
        
print ("Maximum is", largest)  
print ("Minimum is", smallest)
