# _Coursera_Programming-For-Everybody_Getting_Start-with-Python

Coursera providing this course 'Programming for Everybody(Getting Start with Python)'
Feeling happy to share this detail to you guys.🥰🥰
In this course you will learn about the basic of python 🐍 programming language.

   Here you will learn these:-
-  **Week 1** 🐾🐾🐾 **(Introduction)** 🐾 🐾🐾
 -  The first part of Chapter One where we explore what it means to write programs. We finish Chapter One and have the quiz and first assignment in the third week of the class. Throughout the course you may want to        come back and look at these materials. This section should not take you an entire week.
   
-  **Week 2 🧐 🧐 (Installtion of Python)** 🧐 🧐
    -  In this module you will set things up so you can write Python programs. Not all activities in this module are required for this class so please read the "Using Python in this Class" material for details.
    -  Installation of python editor using Linux/Machintosh and Windows
    -  Hello World Code.(You first python code)
      
-  **Week 3** 😏 😏 **(Chapter 1)** 😏 😏
    -  This chapter is quite broad and you would benefit from reading the chapter in the book in addition to watching the lectures to help it all sink in. You might want to come back and re-watch these lectures after         you have funished a few more chapters.
    -  Reading the code block of pyton and taking your first assigment.
    -  And more inspiration knowledge about the python
      
- **Week 4** 😯 😯 **(Chapter 2)** 😯 😯
    -  In this chapter you cover how a program uses the computer's memory to store, retrieve and calculate information.
    -  Varibales
    -  Experssions
    -  Quiz
    -  Assigments Exercise
      
-  **Week 5** 🤩 🤩 **(Chapter 3)** 🤩 🤩
 -  In this section you move from sequential code that simply runs one line of code after another to conditional code where some steps are skipped. It is a very simple concept - but it is how computer software makes       "choices".
    -  Conditional Statements
        -  if
        -  else
        -  elif
    -  Quiz
    -  Assigments Exercise
      
-  **Week 6** 🥴 🥴 **(Chapter 4)** 🥴 🥴
    -  This is a relatively short chapter. You will learn about what functions are and how we can use them. The programs in the first chapters of the book are not large enough to require us to develop functions, but          as the book moves into more and more complex programs, functions will be an essential way for us to make sense of our code.
    -  Functions
    -  Building Functions
    -  Quiz
    -  Assigments Exercise
      
-  **Week 7** 😣 😣 **(Chapter 5)** 😗 🤔 🤨 😣 😣
    -  Loops and iteration complete our four basic programming patterns. Loops are the way we tell Python to do something over and over. Loops are the way we build programs that stay with a problem until the problem          is solved.
    -  Loops and iterations
    -  Define Loops
    -  Finding the largest number
    -  Loop idioms
    -  Quiz
    -  Assigments Exercise
